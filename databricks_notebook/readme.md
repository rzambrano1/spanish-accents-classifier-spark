### Databricks Notebook

The databricks notebook is saved as a dbc file, which is not compatible with GitHub. 

In order to view the content of the databricks notebook download either the ipynb, the pdf, or the HTML versions of the file.

**Note:** Commands that were meant to be run only once were commented out after they were run. For example, downloading the zipped file from Common Voice, or (more importantly), the command to unzip the dataset. The goal of commenting them out was to avoid running them again by accidentally selecting 'Run All' instead of running just a single line in the Databricks notebook.
